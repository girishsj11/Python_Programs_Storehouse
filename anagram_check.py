Anagram Program in python

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a 
different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters 
exactly once. 
For example: the word anagram itself can be rearranged 
into nagaram, also the word binary into brainy and 
the word adobe into abode.
